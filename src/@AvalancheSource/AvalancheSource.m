    % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %
    % Initialize:
    %   AvalancheSource() -- empty object
    %
    %   In NORSE:
    %       AvalancheCH(oNORSE)
    %       InitializeParts()
    %		SynchSettings()
    %
    %   The avalanche source at time t is built via a call to
    %       Assemble(t).
    %   It is then accessible through the class property avaS.
